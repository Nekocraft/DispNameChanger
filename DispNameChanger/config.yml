# Message settings change the behavior of DNC in reguards to
#   the login/logout, kick, and death messages including the
#   display name.
# true: message should be changed to include display name.
# false: message should be left alone.
# ----
# Global-Announce sets whether a global announcement of display
#   names to users should be made whenever one is changed.
#   Target represents either Admins only, or All users.
# ALL: All users will recieve the name change broadcast.
# ADMIN: Only users with the permission node 'dispname.announce'
#   will recieve broadcasts.
# ----
# Prefix toggles whether a character is prepended to display
#   names. The default character is +. If a string is provided,
#   the first character in the string is used as the prefix.
#   If the string is blank, the default is used.
#   The prefix character MUST BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES (' ')!
#   The color code allows you to change the color of the prefix
#   to be used. You do not have to put a & or # to specify the color
#   code.
# Color Codes can be found here:
# http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes
# ----
# Scoreboard toggles the use of the scoreboard integration.
#   Note: Integration into scoreboard will force the player 
#   display names to be unique. Names longer than 16 characters
#   will be truncated on the player list. Each color code counts
#   for two characters.
